## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest (API endpoints, utility functions)
- **Integration Tests**: Simulate real workflows (e.g., parent payments + accountant views)
- **End-to-End Tests**: Cypress (complete user flows)
- **Manual Testing**: Pilots with sample classes for realistic feedback
- **Mock APIs**: Swagger & Postman collection included

## 🧱 Database Design (NoSQL: MongoDB)

### Core Collections:

- **Users**: `{ id, role, email, name, password_hash }`
- **Students**: `{ id, name, grade, guardian_id, fee_balance, attendance_records }`
- **Payments**: `{ id, student_id, amount, channel, timestamp, status }`
- **Invoices**: `{ id, student_id, term, amount_due, status }`
- **Attendance**: `{ id, student_id, class_id, date, status }`

### ER Notes:

- Guardians are linked to Students
- Teachers linked to Classes
- Classes associated with Subjects
- Attendance tracks per-class and per-day status
